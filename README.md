Webscraper to get schedules for uoit courses

This script obtains the course information one Program at a time
and puts it into a database to be used to find available rooms at
UOIT for students to study since study space has become so scarce.
Also to give the ability for students to preview what their schedule 
will be like before actually adding the courses which will allow 
students to see whether there are any scheduling conflicts for 
courses that they want to take. At some point I intend to use this 
for mobile application development so that this information can be 
available for students to access on their android of Blackberry 10 
devices. No intentions to make iPhone applications at this time.
